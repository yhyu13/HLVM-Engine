# HLVM-Engine

## Brief

是工作中受UE启发的个人游戏引擎练习项目，在搭建游戏引擎关键基础设施的同时，额外目标是创造比UE5更友好更便捷的pak文件查读和内存管理、遥测系统，同时磨刀linux开发工具链和c++20特性熟练度，不涉及渲染动画特效等一系列游戏内容开发的工作流程，欢迎交流学习

## Build

### Linux-x64

#### Prerequisites:

配置暂时放在zhihu上，有时间再放到项目bundle在一起
https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/677704467

- Anaconda3
- git
- clang-16
- cmake 3.28

然后
```
./Setup.sh
./GenerateCMakeProjects.sh
```

## Features

 - Implement custom build system called `PyCMake` python package
   - Internally generates CMake projects
   - Unit testing with CTest
 - Platform-specific code for Linux and Windows
   - Platform specific Compare Swap Exchange
   - Platform specific debuggin utilities
 - File system handling with Boost
   - Use `Boost` for local file mapping
   - Use `fstream` for file reading and writing
   - Support `std` compatible file modes
   - Implement a set of standard C file operations in cpp
 - Compression 
   - Using `Zstd` with a cpp wrapper
 - Encryption
   - Using `Botan3` wrapped in an interface
   - Use RSA OAEP for encryption
   - Use RSA EMSA for signatures
   - Generate PKCS8 RSA 256 keys in binary but obfuscated
 - Logging system
   - Implement UE5 like logging macro `HLVM_LOG(LogXXX, debug, TXT(...), ...)`
     - Easy define new `LogXXX` log category
     - Compile time eliminate unwanted logging levels based on settings made in each log category
   - Implement UE5 like log device redirector
     - Using `spdlog` as one of the log device to pump log into various sinks (e.g. files, console)
     - Pump `spdlog`'s `trace debug and infor` into async thread so that these logs won't block
     - `warn, err and critical` log are sync flushed
 - Custom memory management withe heap and stack allocation
   - Implement mallocator interface class where mimalloc and stack alocator can derive from
     - Implement TLS `GMallocator` which use TLS mimallocator as default
     - Override global `new` and `delete` to use `GMallocator`
     - Combine with `Scoped variable` to swap in & out TLS `GMallocator` with temporal allocator
 - Obfuscation techniques for sensitive strings
   - Use `AdvoObfuscator` to obfuscate short strings
   - Implement simpler stack free obfuscation method for long string (e.g. RSA private keys)
 - Custom string handling
   - Use `chat8_t` as string char type, as it is compatible with `char` simply by reinterpreting cast
   - Implement UE5 like string handling, e.g. `TXT("...")` and `FString` type to replace `std::string`
   - Implement `FPath` which internally uses `boost::filesystem::path` and cached path fast hash
 - Custom file system handling with packing support
   - Token file 
     - describes the file structure (e.g. offset, size, compression, etc)
     - Store `size_t` hash instead of string path (smaller token file size but not able to search and parse file paths in runtime)
     - debug json file that describes the token file content in human-readable format
   - Container file
     - tightly packs the data files for memory mapping
     - Runtime fragment that loads a minimal 4MB of mapped file region per fragment
     - Proxy that load actual content using token entry and container fragment
 - Custom exception handling
   - No-inline exception handling function (avoid lengthy inline assembly code for string formatting)
   - Using `backwardcpp` from debugging utilities to print stack trace
   - Using `spdlog` for logging and `fmt` to combine exception message, stacktrace and file & lino
 - Boost hashing functions
   - MD5 digest hash and converting to hex string
   - SHA1 digest hash and converting to hex string
 - Custom template meta-programming for common tasks
   - String obfuscation (e.g. in binary private key, password, etc)
   - Compile time regex matching `ctre` for assertion checkings
   - Scoped variable templates (e.g. scoped file handle, scoped timer, etc)
   - Optional object reference removal
   - Reference object removal
   - Non-null pointer template
   - Memory-alloc free `printf` template
 - Debugging utilities for Linux and Windows
   - Using `ptrace` under linux to determine if a debugger is present
   - Using `WinAPI` under windows to determine if a debugger is present
   - Using `backwardcpp` library to print stack trace, support user skipping `N` frames from bottom
 - Parallelism
   - Spin lock
     - Use `std::atomic_flag` which is mutex free
     - Use `_mm_pause` and thread yielding to avoid busy waiting
     - Deaklock timer and lock guard
   - Rival lock
     - Avoid using `spin lock` on cases where only reading and writing are enough are mutually exclusive
     - Use `rival lock` so that all reading are permissive and mutually exclusive to writing, and vice versa
   - Concurrent `SPSC/MPSC/MPMC` queue
     - Inspired from UE5 lock free (i.e. compare swap exchange)`TQueue` implementation but extend to MPMC
     - 1.5x performance of Boost `lockfree::queue` (See test case TestParallel) 
     - Found out that use `cv` and `std::mutex` to block on poping (if empty) actually increase performance
   - Work Steal thread pool
     - Use a pool of `std::thread` and return `std::future` to use
     - Use `Concurrent MPMC queue` (with block on empty feat) to store tasks internally
     - Implement `work stealing` algorithm to get tasks efficiently to the latest idle worker
